# check-git-tags-for-match
Check all git tags for a match. Scripts and illustration.

# check_git_tags_for_match.sh

## Description
This script can be used to check if a given git tag already exists in any git repository.

## Why?
1) The exact logic or components therein can be useful in various automation / build & deploy / glue scenarios. 
2) Some learning of things I always forget and need to look-up.
3) As always; Why not?

## Outputs
**Exit code 0** - The search ran but that tag does not exist in the repository.   
**Exit code 3** - The search ran and found that the tag already exists in the repository.  
**Exit code 1** - A failure occured, likely because of input validation.  

## Prerequisites
```
# Download the script.
# Change directory to this (or any other) git repository.
cd check-git-tags-match

# Ensure you can run the following:
# Expect tags output (if any) and 0 exit code.
git tag -l
echo $?

# Make executable so you can use (assumes script in the same dir).
chmod +x check_git_tags_for_match.sh
```

## Dependencies
* Requires git client installed.
* POSIXy environment.


## Usage
```
# Execute the script where <git-tag> is the tag you are searching for.
sh check_git_tags_for_match.sh <git-tag>

# Expect useful output. But use exit codes as defined above to make further decisions:
# See usage.sh for minimal automated usage implementation.
# And see the 'Tests' section for some specific examples.
```

## Tests

### Environment
This repository has been gerry-rigged as a test environment for the script. It has been set up with a load of dummy taggs which represent different "versions".

### List tags
GitHub Website > This Repository > Releases.  
GitHub Website > Branch dropdown > Tags tab.
```
# Clone repo, cd into repo, list # of tags.
git tags -l | wc -l
# output
10

# List tags.
git tags -l
# output
v0.1.0
v0.1.1
v0.1.2
v0.1.3
v0.1.4
v0.2.0
v0.3.0
v0.3.1
v0.3.2
v1.0.0
```

### Cases
*More test inputs to be exercised but only one / a few examples to be documented here.*  
**Functional - Positive:**  
* A valid tag input already on the repository returns exit code 3 and a useful message. âœ…
```
# 0 
$ sh check_git_tags_for_match.sh hello && echo $?
This tag does not already exist in this repository. Success.
0

# 1
$ sh check_git_tags_for_match.sh v2.0.0 && echo $?
This tag does not already exist in this repository. Success.
0

```
**Functional - Negative:**  
* A valid tag input not already on the repository returns exit code 0 and a useful message.
* Running without an input argument is caught out with a useful message.
* Running with a empty string input argument is caught out with a useful message.
* Running with a whitespace string input argument is caught out with a useful message.
* Running with some invalid GitHub tag inputs are caught out with a useful message.


## Design
TODO

# check_git_tags_for_match_alt.sh
A minimal implementation which does (approximately) the same thing in 5 lines. But ofcourse, there are trade-offs...

# Improvements
* Help / Usage documentation inside the script.
* Ability to pass in location of the git project so that the runner does not need to be within the project directory to use the script: https://git-scm.com/docs/git#Documentation/git.txt---git-dirltpathgt.
* Use flags to pass in args more clearly.
* Automate the easily automatable tests.
